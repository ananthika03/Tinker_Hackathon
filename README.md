### Project Description
Our project is a **web-based event booking platform** that brings together venues and event services for both cultural and professional events in one place. Customers can browse, shortlist, and quickly find suitable options , while venue and service providers can manage their listings through dedicated dashboards.


### The Problem statement
Organizing cultural events (weddings, temple functions, community events) and professional events (meetings, conferences, seminars) requires searching for venues and services like catering, decoration, and photography across multiple platforms. On the customer side, this leads to time-consuming comparisons, scattered information, and difficulty in contacting providers. On the provider side, venue owners and service providers lack a centralized platform to showcase and manage their offerings efficiently.

### The Solution
We developed a web-based multi-role event booking platform that connects customers with venue and service providers in one centralized system.
On the customer side, users can browse venues and services, view details such as pricing and capacity, and shortlist preferred options.
On the provider side, venue owners and service providers have dedicated dashboards where they can add, update, and manage their listings.
This creates a structured, organized, and user-friendly environment for planning and managing events efficiently.
