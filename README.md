### Project Description
Our project is a **web-based event booking platform** that brings together venues and event services for both cultural and professional events in one place. Customers can browse, shortlist, and quickly find suitable options , while venue and service providers can manage their listings through dedicated dashboards.


### The Problem statement
Organizing cultural events (weddings, temple functions, community events) and professional events (meetings, conferences, seminars) requires searching for venues and services like catering, decoration, and photography across multiple platforms. On the customer side, this leads to time-consuming comparisons, scattered information, and difficulty in contacting providers. On the provider side, venue owners and service providers lack a centralized platform to showcase and manage their offerings efficiently.

### The Solution
We developed a web-based multi-role event booking platform that connects customers with venue and service providers in one centralized system.
On the customer side, users can browse venues and services, view details such as pricing and capacity, and shortlist preferred options.
On the provider side, venue owners and service providers have dedicated dashboards where they can add, update, and manage their listings.
This creates a structured, organized, and user-friendly environment for planning and managing events efficiently.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
